# Appealing Rejection Message Feature

## Overview

This feature enhances the order rejection process by providing appealing, professional messages to brands when creators reject their orders. Instead of a simple "Order was cancelled" message, brands now receive thoughtful, encouraging messages that maintain positive relationships and suggest alternative creators.

## Features

### 1. Appealing Rejection Messages
- **Professional Tone**: Messages are written in a professional, appreciative tone
- **Relationship Building**: Maintains positive relationships between creators and brands
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Encourages brands to explore other creators on the platform
- **Randomized Messages**: System randomly selects from a pool of appealing messages

### 2. Custom Messages
- Creators can provide their own custom rejection message
- If no custom message is provided, system generates an appealing message automatically

### 3. Enhanced Brand Experience
- Brands see appealing messages instead of harsh rejection notifications
- "Browse Other Creators" button for easy navigation to find alternatives
- Maintains positive user experience even when orders are rejected

## Database Changes

### Order Model Update
Added `rejection_message` field to the Order model:

```prisma
model Order {
  // ... existing fields
  rejection_message String?      // Appealing message when order is rejected
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### Migration
Run the following migration to add the new field:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_rejection_message_to_orders
```

## API Changes

### Updated Rejection Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `PUT /api/orders/:orderId/reject`

**Request Body** (optional):
```json
{
  "rejectionMessage": "Custom appealing message from creator"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Order rejected successfully",
  "order": {
    "id": "123",
    "status": "cancelled",
    "rejection_message": "Thank you for considering my services!..."
  }
}
```

### Automatic Message Generation
If no custom message is provided, the system generates one of these appealing messages:

1. **Workload Message**: "Thank you for considering my services! Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to take on this project due to my current workload. I'd love to collaborate in the future when my schedule opens up. In the meantime, I'd recommend checking out some other talented creators who might be a perfect fit for your project!"

2. **Quality Commitment Message**: "I appreciate you reaching out with this opportunity! At the moment, I'm fully booked with existing commitments and want to ensure I can deliver the quality you deserve. Please explore our platform to discover other amazing creators who are available and excited to work on your project!"

3. **Capacity Message**: "Thank you for your interest in working together! I'm currently at capacity with ongoing projects and wouldn't want to compromise on the quality of your content. I encourage you to browse through our community of skilled creators who are ready to bring your vision to life!"

4. **Standards Message**: "I'm honored that you considered me for this project! Unfortunately, my current schedule doesn't allow me to take on additional work while maintaining the high standards I set for myself. Please take a look at some other fantastic creators on our platform who would be thrilled to collaborate with you!"

5. **Excellence Message**: "Thank you for reaching out! I'm currently focused on delivering excellence to my existing clients and wouldn't want to overcommit. I'd love to work together in the future! Meanwhile, I'm sure you'll find the perfect creator match for your project among our talented community."

## Mobile App Changes

### Updated Order Interface
```typescript
interface Order {
  // ... existing fields
  rejection_message?: string;
}
```

### Enhanced Brand Experience
- **Appealing Messages**: Brands see the appealing rejection message instead of "Order was cancelled"
- **Browse Button**: Added "Browse Other Creators" button for cancelled orders
- **Navigation**: Button navigates to BrandHome to explore other creators

### Updated OrdersScreen
- Modified to display `rejection_message` when order status is 'cancelled'
- Added "Browse Other Creators" button with styling
- Enhanced user experience for brands viewing rejected orders

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creator Rejects Order (Default Message)
```javascript
// Creator rejects order without custom message
const response = await ordersAPI.rejectOrder(orderId);
// System automatically generates appealing message
```

### 2. Creator Rejects Order (Custom Message)
```javascript
// Creator provides custom appealing message
const customMessage = "Thank you for reaching out! I'm currently focused on a specific niche and wouldn't be the best fit for your project. I'd recommend checking out creators who specialize in your industry!";
const response = await ordersAPI.rejectOrder(orderId, customMessage);
```

### 3. Brand Views Rejected Order
```javascript
// Brand sees appealing message instead of harsh rejection
const orders = await ordersAPI.getOrders();
const rejectedOrder = orders.find(order => order.status === 'cancelled');
console.log(rejectedOrder.rejection_message);
// Output: "Thank you for considering my services!..."
```
