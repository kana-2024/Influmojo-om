# Codebase Corrections Summary

## Issues Found and Fixes Applied

### 1. **Order Acceptance Error (Critical) - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: The order acceptance endpoint was failing with "Failed to accept order" error.
**Location**: `mobile/services/apiService.ts` and `backend/src/routes/orders.js`
**Root Cause**: The accept order endpoint was not properly handling BigInt conversion and user authentication.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated the accept order endpoint to properly handle BigInt conversion
- ✅ Added proper error handling for user authentication
- ✅ Fixed the order service to handle creator ID validation correctly
- ✅ Added input validation for orderId and creatorId
- ✅ Improved error messages for better user experience

**Issue**: Too many console.log statements throughout the codebase, especially in production code.
**Locations**: Multiple files including `mobile/services/apiService.ts`, `backend/src/routes/`, etc.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Removed unnecessary debug console.log statements
- ✅ Kept only essential error logging
- ✅ Added conditional logging for development mode only (`__DEV__`)
- ✅ Cleaned up mobile screens and backend routes

### 3. **Error Handling Improvements - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across the application.
**Locations**: `mobile/services/apiService.ts`, `backend/src/routes/`

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Standardized error response format
- ✅ Added proper try-catch blocks
- ✅ Improved error messages for better user experience
- ✅ Added proper validation for API inputs

### 4. **Authentication Token Issues - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: Token validation and storage issues in mobile app.
**Location**: `mobile/services/apiService.ts`

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Added proper token refresh handling
- ✅ Fixed token storage and retrieval
- ✅ Added better error handling for authentication failures

### 5. **API Response Parsing - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: JSON parsing errors in API responses.
**Location**: `mobile/services/apiService.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added safe JSON parsing with fallbacks
- ✅ Improved error handling for malformed responses
- ✅ Added content-type validation
- ✅ Better error messages for parsing failures

### 6. **Database Connection Issues - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: Potential database connection leaks and improper error handling.
**Location**: `backend/src/server.js`

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added proper database connection management
- ✅ Improved error handling for database operations
- ✅ Added graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Added uncaught exception and unhandled rejection handlers

### 7. **Security Improvements - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: Some security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
**Locations**: Multiple files

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added input validation for order IDs and user IDs
- ✅ Improved authentication checks
- ✅ Added proper authorization checks
- ✅ Removed sensitive information from error responses in production

### 8. **Mobile App Performance - FIXED ✅**
**Issue**: Potential performance issues in mobile app.
**Locations**: Various mobile screens

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Optimized component rendering
- ✅ Added proper loading states
- ✅ Improved error handling in UI components
- ✅ Removed excessive logging in production

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `mobile/services/apiService.ts` - Fixed API request handling and error management
2. ✅ `backend/src/routes/orders.js` - Fixed order acceptance endpoint
3. ✅ `backend/src/server.js` - Improved error handling and configuration
4. ✅ `backend/src/services/orderService.js` - Fixed order service logic
5. ✅ `mobile/screens/MobileVerifiedScreen.tsx` - Removed excessive logging
6. ✅ `mobile/screens/SignUpScreen.tsx` - Cleaned up debug logging
7. ✅ `backend/src/routes/auth.js` - Removed excessive console logging

## Testing Recommendations
